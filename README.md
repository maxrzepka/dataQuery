# dataQuery

A non-intrusive solution to query data of any kind.

  - Plain file in any format ( excel , pdf, xml ).
  - Relational DB
  - Other storage

The pipe processing is performed directly from the source.
On contrary conventional DataWarehouse solution first extracts all data in big central repository (ETL stage).

The goal is to produce analytics starting with the aggregation operation likewise the SQL's group by.
Is there a need for a new query language ?
No, just simple datastructure Ã  la datalog is enough like in cascalog or datomic.

## Concepts

### Schema

The source can be in various format but source need a unique schema for queries.
The definition of source can be split into 2 parts :
  - storage : how access the data for example file-system information (path , format) , db host and more specific storage infos
  - schema : inspired from Kimball's star-schema, it uses the notions of dimension and measure

```clojure
{:dimension [:type :region :country],
 :key [:acct],
 :measure [:balance :commission],
 :fields [:acct :type :region :country :balance :commission],
 :data
 ({:region "Europe",
   :type "B",
   :country "Germany",
   :acct "A1",
   :balance 203,
   :commission 8.97}
 ...)
 }
```

### Query

A query is a plain map which at the execution expandes to a cascalog query , SQL or other API.

```clojure
{ :aggregate #{:type} :filter {:region "Europe"} :source s}
```

### Storage

As the schema and query language is independent of the storage,
adding new type of storage should be straightforward.

### Custom Columns
Adding new column should be also declarative.
Here an example of a column named balance-bins that groups records according their balance buckets.

```clojure
{:balance-bins [:bucket :balance 0 1000 10000]}
```
